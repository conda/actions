      # cla-trigger.yml uses pull_request_target but is safe because:
      # - It does NOT checkout any code from the PR
      # - It only saves PR metadata (number, author, url, sha) to artifacts
      # - No secrets are used in this workflow
      - cla-trigger.yml

      # cla.yml uses workflow_run which is the SAFE alternative to pull_request_target
      # - Secrets are only accessed after the trigger workflow completes
      # - PR context is passed via artifacts, not from untrusted event payload
      # - No code from the PR is ever checked out or executed
      - cla.yml

      # project.yml uses pull_request_target but is safe because:
      # - It does NOT checkout any code from the PR
      # - It only adds PRs to a GitHub project using actions/add-to-project
      # - The only dynamic value used is github.event_name which cannot be spoofed
      - project.yml

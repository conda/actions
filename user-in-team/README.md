# User in Team

This NodeJS package is designed to be both a GitHub Action and a CLI tool. The latter primarily being available for debugging and testing purposes.

## GitHub Action Usage

In your GitHub repository include this action in your workflows:

```yaml
- id: in_team
  uses: conda/actions/user-in-team
  with:
    # [required]
    # the team org
    org: conda

    # [required]
    # the team name
    team: conda-core

    # [optional]
    # the user to search for
    # if not provided return list of user in team
    user: conda-bot

    # [required]
    # the github token with read:org access
    github_token: ${{ secrets.PROJECT_TOKEN }}

# if user was provided we get a boolean
- if: steps.in_team.outputs.contains == 'true'
  ...

# if no user provided we get a list of users
- if: contains(steps.in_team.outputs.contains.*, 'conda-bot')
  ...
```

```

npm run <src|dist> -- --help

# list users in orgs/conda/teams/conda-core

```
